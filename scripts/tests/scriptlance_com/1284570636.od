<td style="padding:4" class=dt2 valign=top>Recently our Big Commerce shopping cart (<a href="http://www.nexxtwave.com" target="extlink" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;color:#68778E" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">http://www.nexxtwave.com</a>) got upgraded and now in internet explorer, on the front page and a couple other pages, the main content area with products doesn't show.  In firefox and other browsers it looks great.  Please check and compare.  Support people think it might be a couple tags that are wrong or maybe JS that's messing it up, but just pointed us to:<br><br><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http" target="extlink" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;color:#68778E" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http</a>%3A%2F%<a href="http://2Fwww.nexxtwave.com" target="extlink" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;color:#68778E" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">2Fwww.nexxtwave.com</a>%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&ss=1&group=0&verbose=1&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.1#line-97<br><br>Preferably you have experience with Big Commerce, but I need someone who can go in and make the change to have this site work in Internet Explorer ASAP.  I'm hoping you're online right now and can start immediately.  <br><br>Thanks!<br><br><br>
