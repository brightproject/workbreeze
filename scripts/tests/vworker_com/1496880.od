I have a VB.Net program that loads a configuration to a Cisco router using an external TFTP server program. &#160;I would like the program to be able to load this without using a 3rd party TFTP application, so it creates one&#160;integrated&#160;program.<div><br /></div><div>Also the program sends the commands via a serial port, I would like it to send them via an IP telnet connection, so I do not need to use a Serial port.</div><div><br /></div><div>All the commands are the same, except a user and password are needed to connect on TelNet.</div><div><br /></div><div>The aim is to make this application&#160;completely&#160;stand alone without the need for any 3rd party software.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just to be clear the application needs to include TFTP Server and not client.</div>
