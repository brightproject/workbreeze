<td style="padding:4" class=dt2 valign=top>My site <a href="http://prbot.com" target="extlink" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;color:#68778E" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none'">prbot.com</a> has paid plan that uses paypal button. The plan in this place has more fields than I need. It already interacts with admin to create a Press release that gets published. I would like to save current form for possible later date and clone the current form with less fields. <br><br>1)I want to make it so it accepts payment with ejunkie buttons with 4 price points. <br><br>$25 for 1 release<br>$49 for 3 for the month<br>$69 for up to 5  unlimited PRs for the  month<br>$99 for unlimited prs for the  month.<br><br>2)<br>The site should accomodate above and allow only set amount of releases per month based on point (or unlimited). <br><br>3)It will also block multiple company names used on each release so user can only make releases for one company and not many. With each plan purchased it must all be used for same company.<br><br>4)I want the amount of releases per month for each plan level to be editable. I can edit price in ejunkie admin.<br><br>5)You will make current user admin area show  how many releases they have remaining. With option to renew or upgrade or downgrade.<br><br>6) All featured releases will display in new area on top of free releases you create called featured press releases.<br><br>7) Admin will be notified of all paid releases via email<br><br>8) Admin will have option to approve releases before going live ( site now has option to set delay on when published).<br><br>9) I would like RSS feed made with just the featured releases.<br><br>- Make following edits on site. <br>10) Make search box on see all press releases page be same as homepage search box.<br><br>11) make grean box highlighting page views accomodate 3 digit numbers. These are on home page and see all press releases page. <br><br><br><br><br>
