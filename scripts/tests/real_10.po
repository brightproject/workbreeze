I need someone to write (20) 300 word articles each based on a keyword that I provide to you. The articles will be about antique furniture in general. But each article will focus on a specific kind...that's where the keywords come in.<br /><br />I would prefer someone who can do this on a monthly basis for me. So if all goes good this time around, I will hire you to do this same project every month.<br /><br />I need you to take those articles and submit them to the following directories for me. So the articles need to fit within the guidelines of the major directories like ezine articles etc.<br /><br /><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">http://www.articlesbase.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.goarticles.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">http://www.goarticles.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.articledashboard.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.articlealley.com/" rel="noindex,nofollow">http://www.articlealley.com/</a><br /><br />**More info below**
