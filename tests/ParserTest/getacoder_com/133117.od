Example Websites that reflect what I need: (Please look at these websites)<br><br>Care.com, Sittercity.com, sitters.com<br><br>I like to develop a care website with a subscription service. The purpose of the application is to create user profiles from <br><br>caregivers so that subscribers (care seekers) have a pool of candidates to choose from. Examples of care are senior care, pet <br><br>care, child care, housekeeper care, tutoring/lessons.<br><br> <br><br><br>Functionality Involved:<br><br>The site will developed using PHP<br><br>The site will need a proximity locator.<br>The site will also have sms integrated into it to send messages out to caregivers.<br><br>Profiles will include ratings, backround check information, job history, contact information for paying subscribers, <br><br>feedback, user picture.<br><br><br><br>The project must include:<br>- Design implementation (I can hire a graphic artist for the graphics as needed)<br>- User Management (Sign in/Sign up)<br>- Account Management [User Profile features (picture, background, etc)]<br>- Admin Management (3 different levels of admin, e.g,. overall system admin, Supervisory Staff and regular staff) <br>- Ratings/Feedback<br>- Proximity Locator (Zipcode Locator: ability to display caregivers based on nearness to care seeker's zip code)<br>-Online Payment integration for subscription or other chargeable items (via our credit card merchant account gateway)<br>- Miscellaneous (Development Revisions)<br><br>1. Homepage<br>2. Care Giver's search result page<br>3. Step by step Caregiver Registration Form pages --different levels that include free basic level as well some paid packages <br><br>with more features)<br>4. Step by step caregiver registration means multiple step registration process(Like select plan,General info and then <br><br>activation page)<br>5. Care Givers will have provision to upload their resume, picture and You tube Video after regsitration<br>6. Job posting by subscribers (care seekers) -- some payment to be done by the subscriber in order to post unlimited jobs, <br><br>add Caregiver to favorites, get access to unlimited Care Giver profiles etc...<br>7. Again, Multiple step registration(Plan,info,payment and then confirmation)...<br>8. Subscribers can leave Feedback or rate(5 star rating system) a Care Giver...<br>9. Testimonials page(A form which when filled out by the Care Givers or the Subscribers....will come to the Site <br><br>Administration...and reviewed by the Site admin...it will get displayed on the Homepage And Testimonials page.<br><br>A very important aspect of the project is the proximity locator which queries the database using a persons zipcode to find <br><br>caregivers closest to them. An example can be seen on care.com homepage.<br><br><br><br>The website will also have background check integration. This will be in the form of a person (for example, a caregiver) <br><br>paying through the system for the background check and we will ping the webs service of a third party which will do the <br><br>background check and return the info to us for automatic loading into our database.<br><br>I would like the application to resemble the one care.com in functionality as much as possible. Other example site to look at <br><br>along the same line are sittercity.com and sitters.com.<br><br>Please note that I am willing and ready to provide step by step guidance and additional logic information as may be <br><br>neccesary, so do not hesitate to ask me if unsure of anything, instead of making the wrong assumption.
